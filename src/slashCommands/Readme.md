# /slashCommands

/slashCommands contains slashCommands that the bot can run.

The commands are created with a [SlashCommandBuilder](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html#before-you-continue).

SlashCommands.ts exports all the commands in a map.

This map is subsequently used by the discordJS client to process all possible commands.

Note, new slash commands may not appear for a while
